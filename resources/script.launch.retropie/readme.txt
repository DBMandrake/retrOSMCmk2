This addon is a bare-bones Emulationstation launcher for Kodi - cobbled together by Hissingshark

It is intended to be run on the OSMC box "Vero4k".

It depends upon a suitable systemd unit and supporting launcher script being installed - written by DBMandrake

Installation is via the RetroPie installer:
