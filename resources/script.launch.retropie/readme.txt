This addon is an Emulationstation launcher for Kodi - cobbled together by Hissingshark

It is intended to be run under OSMC on the Vero4k or RPi 1-3.

Options include:
CEC exit button - so you can quit back to Kodi using a TV remote.
TODO/WIP - Evdev exit button - so you can quit back to Kodi using a gamepad.
Disable CEC exit events - stops Kodi putting the TV into standby when launching ES.
TODO/WIP - Fast switcher - keeps Kodi and RetroPie in memory so you can instantly toggle between them.

Installation is via the RetroPie installer:
